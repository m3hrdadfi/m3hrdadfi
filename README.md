### Hi There ðŸ‘‹

It's me, Mehrdad Farahani [(Pronounce me)](https://www.nameshouts.com/names/persian/pronounce-mehrdad-farahani). I am passionate about high-tech solutions to real-world problems with my previous NLP, Deep Learning, and Machine Learning skills. I have collaborated as a researcher, Deep Learning Engineer, and NLP Engineer with over 3+ years of experience in academic, startup, and research environments. I put my effort into the natural language field in the last few years since I believe artificial intelligence will inevitably affect all aspects of our lives sooner or later, specifically how humans communicate and share their knowledge.
