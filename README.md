### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mehrdad Farahani [(Pronounce me)](https://www.nameshouts.com/names/persian/pronounce-mehrdad-farahani). I have served as a researcher, Deep Learning Engineer, and NLP Engineer with over 3+ years of experience in the academic, startup, and research environments. I am passionate about high-tech solutions in handling real-world problems with my previous skills in NLP and Deep Learning. In recent years, I put my effort into the NLP field because I believe AI will inevitably affect all aspects of our lives in the future, specifically in the ways that humans communicated.
