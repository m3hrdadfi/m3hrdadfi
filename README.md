### Hi There 👋 , I'm [Mehrdad Farahani](https://app2.nameshouts.com/names/public/pronounce-mehrdad-farahani)

A fourth-year PhD student at Chalmers and the University of Gothenburg, working on memory arbitration in LLMs. My work connects mechanistic interpretability and controllability, aiming to understand how models internalize, retrieve, and adapt, and how these processes can be guided in practice.
